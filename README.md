# Fourier Neural Operator - Nozzle Flow
This code is part of a M.Sc. thesis that was conducted at Lunds Tekniska Högskola in 2025. It includes MATLAB code for generating quasi one-dimensional analytical data and planar two-dimensional data in a converging-diverging nozzle. The 1D data is generated using analytical solutions using isentropic as well as normal shock relations for quasi 1D flows. The 2D data is solved numerically using a finite volume implementation based on the one introduced for the course "Advanced Methods Within Numerical Fluid Mechanics and Heat Transfer" (MVKN 70) at Lunds Tekniska Högskola, by Assoc Prof. Rixin Yu. Furthermore, the code includes 1D and 2D Fourier neural operator models that were used to predict temperature, pressure and velocity fields based on the initial stagnation conditions, back pressure and also shape function of the nozzle.
